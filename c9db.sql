Struggle began when I needed to convince people, that they need something, that I didn\'t believe they actually need. At least, not for that cost. And, obviously, that was a problem.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>Of course, I was trying different tricks and sometimes it worked, but it didn\'t really made me feel like I was accomplishing something, so I decided that it\'s just not for me and moved on. \r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>Probably, I was able to let it go so easy, because at that time two very close friends (cousin and friend) of mine were living and working in the UK, and they invited me to join them. And it seemed a perfect timing for me to visit some other country, rethink everything and then come back and start again. And that\'s what I did.'),(9,'January 2011 - June 2011','UK / Bognor Regis / Binsted Nursery','Soon after I arrived to the UK, my cousin got me a job at the same place where he was working. It was a place called \'Binsted Nursery\', and they were all about flowers there. And I also became a nursery worker.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>What I liked the most, was the place we were living. It was a beautiful seaside resort, called Bognor Regis and considered as one of the sunniest cities in the UK.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>And, as a temporary experience, it was great. But, at some point, I felt like I don\'t want to work as a nursery worker anymore, I had enough.

But, before that, I wanted to just relax and enjoy the summer. And that\'s exactly what I did.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>Also, there was one week, when I accepted an offer to work as a construction worker. After that week I was sure, never again.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>And, at some point, I somehow managed to get a waiter job. But after one day, I knew clearly, that it\'s definitely not for me. And I gave up my place for someone, who was more interested in it.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>And then the autumn came, party ended and I got more serious about getting a job. And, soon enough, I got one, which, at that time, seemed like a perfect job for me.'),(11,'October 2011 - October 2012','Fans Prosport / Salesman','I started to work as a salesman/sales assistant at the sporting goods store called \'Fans Prosport\'. And in the start it was great, for some time, I really liked this job.\r\n<br /><br /> \r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>But then, after some more time, when I saw exactly, what are the growth opportunities in this career, I began to rethink, if that is really what I want.

I saw, that, no matter how far I can get here, there is nothing, that I would really enjoy doing in the long term.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>So, at some point, this job was starting to take a huge amount of my energy, with a little return.

Though, I was sure, that I wanted to party, so I started with that.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>And, soon enough, I had an offer to become a taxi driver. I accepted it and started my training. And everything seemed fine, until I had my first 24 hour shift, in the city I absolutely didn\'t knew and could navigate only with GPS. And I, also, saw, how little I can earn as a taxi driver.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>So it didn\'t felt like something, that I wanted to keep doing. And, also, for some time, I was already playing an online poker, and I was fascinated by that game, because I saw, that it\'s not just a pure game of luck and it\'s possible to become good at it. So I decided to focus on that insted.'),(13,'March 2013 - March 2015','Poker / Gym','When I started to play poker seriously, very soon I, also, started to attend gym, and stopped partying completely.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>I was learning about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory\" target=\"_blank\">Game Theory</a>, reading a lot of books, analyzing mathematical side of poker (variance, odds, expected value), decision making processes, role of emotions in them and myself, how I react in different situations.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>Also, while I was attending gym, I was educating myself in that area as well. I was researching how exactly human body functions, what is role of every muscle, and, what is the best way, for me, to approach my body and training.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>So, in the end, I didn\'t achieve exactly, what I wanted in poker, but I learned so much. And, I can even say, that poker changed the way I think and see the world.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>If you want to know more, this TEDx Talk explains a lot: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcD7p7snqNg\" target=\"_blank\">TEDxPennQuarter - Frank Lantz - Reinventing Gaming</a>'),(14,'March 2015 - June 2015','Trading','After I was done with poker, I got interested in Forex Trading. The mathematics and analytical side of it, is very similar to poker, so I decided to try it. And I learned about trading as much as I could, in very limited time. \r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>Also, I had some practical experience and came to conclusion, that, to make some meaningful money, I should invest more, than I could at that time. So I decided, that I need to go earn some money in different way, and then come back more seriously.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>Then a friend offered to go and work in Denmark, where he was working. And that seemed like a perfect timing, so I accepted his offer, without any doubt.'),(15,'June 2015 - September 2015','Denmark / Ramirent','When I arrived to Denmark, I started to work the very next day. I worked at Ramirent, who rents out all kinds of construction machinery and that kind of stuff. My job duties were to clean everything, what clients brought back, and to make it ready for renting out again. And that was pretty ok.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>But, given, that living conditions, after work, were pretty bad, at some point I realized, that I want to get away from there, as soon as possible.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>And, as our agreement was, that I will work there till September, I held my end of the deal and, after that, I was happy to get out of there. And I went back to Latvia.'),(16,'September 2015 - October 2016','Health','Well, this period was one of the worst and one of the best of my life, so far.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>Long story short, main focus was on my health state, which at some point was pretty bad, but now I\'m a lot better and, in some way, I\'m even stronger and smarter, than I was before.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>And, obviously, I don\'t want to experience something like that anytime soon, but I have to admit, that, this time, it was actually a very valuable experience.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>And, in the end, it lead me to web development.'),(17,'October 2016 - Now','Coding / Web Development','After my recovery of health issues, I was sure, that I want to learn coding, and I was looking for a good place to start. And then, on October 10, 2016, I registered at <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Free Code Camp</a> and that was a perfect place to start.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>I completed their Front End (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery), Data Visualization (D3.js, React.js) and Back End (Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Git, Command Line) development programs (400 hours each, 1200 hours in total).\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/finaltriumph/front-end-certification\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/images/certificates/FrontEnd.jpg\" class=\"about_cert_img\"/></a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/finaltriumph/data-visualization-certification\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/images/certificates/DataVis.jpg\" class=\"about_cert_img\"/></a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/finaltriumph/back-end-certification\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/images/certificates/BackEnd.jpg\" class=\"about_cert_img\"/></a>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>Then I moved on to <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Codecademy</a> and started by repeating what I knew about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Then learned little more about Git and Command Line. And then started to learn PHP and SQL.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>While I was learning more about PHP, MySQL, Laravel, I also made some random practice projects (some are just pure sketches and are not presentable).\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<span class=\"indent\"></span>After that, I made this website, and now I\'m deciding, what exactly I will do next.');
